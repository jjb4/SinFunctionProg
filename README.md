This project represents the beauty of mathematical functions and how they can be altered to create interesting art. In this prject I used the sin function overlayed over a rectangular shape and rotating back-and-forth to create a mezmorizing effect. I also added changing colors to the shape that mesh into one another. I also added a music file to match the mezmorizing effect with a synth-electronic feel. This is my first upload and I am happy to say it is a success
